# Introduction
Microsoft's Language Understanding and Intelligent Services (LUIS) would be integrated with OpenWeather API to build our own Python chatbot. We would communicate with the chatbot through a web chat. The reason for this project is to introduce Microsoft's Cognitive Services and in this case it would be LUIS with Python. There are plenty of other cognitive services that are also provided by Microsoft.
